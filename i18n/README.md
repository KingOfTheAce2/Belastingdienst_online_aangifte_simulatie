# Translation Notes

The translation resources use the `{year}` placeholder for strings that reference a tax year.
When a sentence can apply to multiple years, `{year}` is replaced dynamically with the appropriate year at runtime.
If a string pertains to a specific tax year, the year value is hardcoded in the translation file.
